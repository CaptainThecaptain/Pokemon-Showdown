[13:21] <Kyosuke_Nanbu> smeargle with 180 HP and 85 everything else
[13:21] <Kyosuke_Nanbu> lol
01[13:22] <captain> smeargle is the haxmon, all obey the haxmon!
[13:22] <%Melee_Mewtwo> magic bounce smeargle
[13:22] <%Melee_Mewtwo> that wrecks ubers
[13:22] <%Melee_Mewtwo> completely rofl stomps it
[13:22] <%Melee_Mewtwo> magic bounce deo d -_-
[13:22] <%Melee_Mewtwo> Ubers will be super HO

[13:22] <%Melee_Mewtwo> ttar for SR
[13:22] <Jkop> Smeargle with BST 605??!
[13:22] <Jkop> !_!
01[13:22] <captain> the reason there is so many magic bouncemons is because there is no sleep clause...or well any clauses but species clause at this point
[13:23] <%Melee_Mewtwo> yeah this is kinda silly
[13:23] <%Melee_Mewtwo> probablh
[13:23] <%Melee_Mewtwo> probably fun*
[13:23] <%Melee_Mewtwo> but silly
01[13:23] <captain> I am silly person
[13:23] <%Melee_Mewtwo> (although, you can't change too much in ubers without things getting unbalanced)
[13:23] <Jkop> Indeed silly, captain
03[13:23] * SoulWind (Mibbit@593470EF.53D6A1F3.22FFC539.IP) has left #ubers
01[13:24] <captain> the question is whether it'd be any fun or whether people would complain about flavor 24/7
[13:24] <Jkop> It depends.
[13:24] <Jkop> Some may like it.
[13:24] <%Melee_Mewtwo> IDk, I personally love the ubers tier
[13:24] <%Melee_Mewtwo> as is
[13:25] <%Melee_Mewtwo> I mean
[13:25] <%Melee_Mewtwo> stuff like Ray can lose v create
[13:25] <%Melee_Mewtwo> and other minor changes like that
[13:25] <%Melee_Mewtwo> but that's just me
[13:25] <Jkop> yeah MM, even i do like it.
01[13:25] <captain> as far as unmodded metas go ubers really is an a-ok tier
01[13:25] <captain> better than standard imo
[13:25] <Kyosuke_Nanbu> simple CM mewtwo :O
[13:25] <reachzero> most things are better than standard
[13:25] <reachzero> standard sucks
[13:26] <Kyosuke_Nanbu> lol i like that latest discussion thread
[13:26] <reachzero> that is the reason so many other metagames are popular right now
03[13:26] * Darknesscrusher (~Darknessc@synIRC-271EEFF6.direct-adsl.nl) has joined #ubers
[13:26] <Kyosuke_Nanbu> like 7 out of the 10 allowed discuss thread allowed
[13:26] <Kyosuke_Nanbu> don't want rain anymore
[13:26] <Kyosuke_Nanbu> lol
02[13:26] * Hyperbeem (~what@is.love.baby.dont.hurt.me) Quit (Quit: Hyperbeem)
[13:26] <reachzero> Sand is stronger
[13:26] <reachzero> so that is silly
[13:26] <%Melee_Mewtwo> ubers is actually p balanced and diverse in and of itself
[13:26] <%Melee_Mewtwo> I don't just play it cause its better than OU
01[13:27] <captain> in my mod, air lock erases the weather and they've all been heavily modified.
[13:27] <%Melee_Mewtwo> but because I find everything I like in it
[13:27] <reachzero> yeah, Ubers is good
[13:27] <reachzero> always has been
[13:27] <%Melee_Mewtwo> since adv?
[13:27] <reachzero> idk about ADV
[13:27] <%Melee_Mewtwo> I know DPP was good
[13:27] <reachzero> but it was great in DPP
[13:27] <reachzero> though better before full Arceus
01[13:27] <captain> hasn't ubers gotten better every generation?
[13:27] <%Melee_Mewtwo> does anybody play DPP with arceus,
[13:27] <reachzero> Farceus meta was fantastic
[13:27] <%Melee_Mewtwo> ?*
[13:27] <%Melee_Mewtwo> I like arceus in BW
[13:28] <Kyosuke_Nanbu> i don't think there was a sim
[13:28] <%Melee_Mewtwo> I can't say since I've yet to play DPP
[13:28] <Kyosuke_Nanbu> that could do gen 4 arceus
[13:28] <Jkop> DPP was better imo.
[13:28] <%Melee_Mewtwo> from what I heard its not as stally
[13:28] <Kyosuke_Nanbu> properly
[13:28] <%Melee_Mewtwo> so I prefer BW
[13:28] <Darknesscrusher> Melee, the one causing Â¨stallyÂ¨ stuff here is you
[13:28] <%Melee_Mewtwo> ;_;
[13:28] <Jkop> lol
